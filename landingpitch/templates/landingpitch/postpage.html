                If you are like me and many other creatives, you have many interests and want to do many things. You’re
                excited at the beginning. Then two weeks later, it’s getting boring and you give up two months later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason is you didn’t meet your goal. You don’t get many subscribers for your newsletter,
                YouTube,
                Instagram,… None read your post or you don’t lose any weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t get me wrong, setting goals for projects is a need. Goals are good for setting direction. But
                achieving
                the goal depends on many aspects. Many of them are external, things that are beyond your control.
